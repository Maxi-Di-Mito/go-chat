# Path finding

## Maps

Maps will include a first line with a "[X]x[Y]" where X is the width and Y is the hight of the map
The next lines will contain the rows ( X number of rows).
Each row will contain Y number of numbers separated by a space.
Each number will be 1 or 0 to indicate if it is walkable or not.
Example:

```
4x4
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1
```

The coordinates start with 0,0 at the top left corner ignoring the first line
